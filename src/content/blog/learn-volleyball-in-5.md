# Learn Volleyball in 5!

Volleyball is an exciting team sport that combines athleticism, strategy, and teamwork. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to improve your skills, this guide will help you master the fundamentals in just 5 steps.

## Step 1: Master the Serve

The serve is how every point begins. Start with an underhand serve for beginners - it's easier to control and more consistent. As you progress, you can move to overhand serves for more power.

## Step 2: Perfect Your Passing

Passing (or bumping) is the foundation of volleyball. Keep your arms straight, form a platform with your forearms, and use your legs to generate power. The ball should contact your forearms, not your hands.

## Step 3: Set with Precision

Setting requires soft hands and good positioning. Use your fingertips to guide the ball to your hitters. Practice setting to different positions on the court.

## Step 4: Attack with Power

Spiking is one of the most exciting parts of volleyball. Approach the net with a three-step approach, jump high, and snap your wrist as you contact the ball at the peak of your jump.

## Step 5: Block and Defend

Blocking is your first line of defense. Time your jump to meet the ball at the net, and use your hands to redirect the ball back to the opponent's court.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Remember, volleyball is a team sport. Communication and practice are key to success. Join a local game or find players through Parkwood Play to put these skills into action!
