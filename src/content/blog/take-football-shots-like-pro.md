# Take Football Shots Like a Pro

Scoring goals is the ultimate thrill in football. Whether you're a striker or a midfielder, mastering shooting techniques will elevate your game.

## The Fundamentals

**Body Position**: Keep your body over the ball, with your non-kicking foot beside the ball. This gives you balance and control.

**Contact Point**: Strike the ball with the laces of your boot, not your toe. This provides power and accuracy.

**Follow Through**: Your kicking leg should follow through toward your target. This ensures power and direction.

## Types of Shots

### Power Shot
For maximum power, lean back slightly and strike through the center of the ball. Use your full leg swing.

### Placement Shot
For accuracy, focus on technique over power. Keep your body balanced and strike with precision.

### Curved Shot
To bend the ball, strike it on the side with the inside or outside of your foot, following through across your body.

## Practice Drills

- Practice shooting from different angles
- Work on both feet
- Practice under pressure with defenders
- Focus on accuracy before power

## Mental Game

Confidence is key. Visualize the ball going into the net before you shoot. Trust your technique and commit to the shot.
